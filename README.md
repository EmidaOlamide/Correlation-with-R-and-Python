# Correlation-with-R-and-Python

In this correlation project, I showcased my R and Python skills.

I answered the following questions using R and Python:

* Do budgets on the movies affect the revenue generated from the movies?
* Do movies’ scores affect the revenue generated from the movies?
* Do movies’ rating affect the revenue generated from the movies?
* What other relationships can be shown?

Read my codes and have fun. Your feedback would be appreciated.

I got the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)
