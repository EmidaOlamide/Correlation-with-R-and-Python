# Correlation-with-R-and-Python

This is a movies dataset. The data contains 7668 rows and 15 columns. 

In this correlation project, I showcased my Python skills.

I answered the following questions using Python:

* Do budgets on the movies affect the revenue generated from the movies?
* Do movies’ scores affect the revenue generated from the movies?
* Do movies’ rating affect the revenue generated from the movies?
* What other relationships can be shown?

I got the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)

I answered the same questions using R. You can view the R version on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/emidaolamide/movies-correlation-r)

Your feedback will be greatly appreciated.

Warm Regards,
